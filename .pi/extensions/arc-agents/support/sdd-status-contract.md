# SDD Status and Action Context Contract

Shared OpenSpec-style contract for Arc Agent SDD phases. Use this before acting on a change so orchestration and executors do not guess state, paths, or edit scope.

## Purpose

Any phase that selects, continues, applies, verifies, syncs, or archives an SDD change MUST first produce or consume structured status. The status is the handoff between the parent orchestrator and phase executor.

## Change Selection

- If a change name is provided, use that exact change after confirming it exists in the selected artifact store.
- If no change name is provided, infer only when the active change is unambiguous from session state or there is exactly one active change.
- If multiple active changes match or the active change is unclear, ask the user to choose. Do not guess.
- If no active changes exist, report that no SDD change is active and suggest starting one.

## Native Engine

- When the session artifact store is `openspec` or `both` (with an `openspec/` directory) and the `arc-ai` binary is available, prefer `arc-ai sdd-status [change] --cwd <repo> --json --instructions` for read-only status and `arc-ai sdd-continue [change] --cwd <repo>` for dispatcher output, and treat their native status JSON as authoritative over prompt inference or manually reconstructed state.
- For non-authoritative stores (`engram`, `none`, and `both` without an `openspec/` directory), do not treat dispatcher output as authoritative; follow Engine Authority by Store below.
- Runtime-attempt authority is different from artifact dispatch: normal runtime-bearing OpenSpec and Engram continuations MUST bracket external execution with `arc-ai sdd-attempt acquire|settle --cwd <repo> --change <change>`. Their bounded result contains only `proceed`, `blocked`, or `complete` plus an opaque continuation token when required, and MAY carry `settle_obligation` on a `proceed`. The Git-common-dir immutable chain remains the sole authority for ordinals, cumulative attempt/line budgets, runtime evidence, and atomic bound remediation.
- A phase actor launched BY a parent that already holds a `proceed`-state acquire for that exact work unit is a distinct call/process, not a fresh continuation: it MUST NOT `acquire` again blind. Colliding with its own parent's active attempt is not a genuine `blocked: active_attempt` (#2291). It authenticates as that SAME attempt by passing the parent's returned token on its own `acquire --token <token>` call: a token matching the ledger's live active attempt returns `proceed` with that same token and zero mutation, while a non-matching token gets the ordinary `blocked: active_attempt` naming the real active token.
- When `blockedReasons` is non-empty, do not proceed to terminal, archive, or apply work. Return or report `blockedReasons` and stop unless `nextRecommended` is `verify`, in which case verification may run only to remediate or refresh evidence for the blockers. When `nextRecommended` is `resolve-blockers`, always report `blockedReasons` and stop. When `nextRecommended` is a planning token (`propose`, `spec`, `design`, or `tasks`), launch the corresponding planning phase — missing planning artifacts are the expected output of those phases, not genuine blockers.
- `nextRecommended` is a bounded machine token for routing, not human prose. Route only by `nextRecommended` and dependency states. Human-readable explanation belongs in `blockedReasons`, not `nextRecommended`.
- If the binary is unavailable, fall back to this prompt contract and the manual status schema below. Manual fallback status MUST stay shape-compatible with the native status JSON even when values are reconstructed manually.

## Status Schema

Return status as markdown with these fields, or equivalent JSON when the host supports it:

```yaml

```

## Task Ownership

Each checkbox may end with one terminal marker: `<!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->` or `<!-- sdd-owner: parent -->`. An unmarked legacy checkbox is implementation-owned. Any line containing `sdd-owner` that is unsupported, duplicated, or non-terminal is malformed: add its exact line to `taskArtifactErrors` and `blockedReasons`, and count it as unresolved implementation work even when checked. `taskProgress` reports implementation work; `deferredParentActions` reports valid parent actions separately.

## Apply State

- `blocked`: required apply artifacts are missing, task selection is ambiguous, malformed ownership markers exist, or action context makes edits unsafe.
- `all_done`: tasks artifact exists and every implementation task is checked `[x]`.
- `ready`: tasks artifact exists, at least one implementation task remains unchecked, and edit scope is safe.
- `not_applicable`: emitted for non-authoritative stores (see Engine Authority by Store). This is NOT a blocker.

## Dependency States

- `apply` is `ready` only when specs, design, and tasks are available and task progress is not all done.
- `verify` is ready only after implementation completion and authoritative parent review approval. Without that approval, the route is `parent-lifecycle`; missing receipt requires the parent to explicitly start bounded review and invalid authority fails closed. Unchecked implementation tasks remain CRITICAL blockers for full archive readiness.
- `sync` is `ready` only when verify-report exists and has no unresolved `FAIL`, `BLOCKED`, `CRITICAL`, or verification blockers. `engram`/`none` modes may mark sync `not_applicable`.
- `archive` is `ready` only when verify-report exists, sync is complete or not applicable, implementation tasks are complete, and explicit deferred mandatory parent actions are reconciled at their native lifecycle boundaries. CRITICAL verification issues have no override. Explicit recorded exceptions are limited to non-critical partial archives or stale-checkbox reconciliation when apply-progress/verify-report prove completion.
- `not_applicable`: emitted for non-authoritative stores (engram, none, and both when no `openspec/` directory exists) when `nextRecommended: "resolve-via-engram"` is active. `not_applicable` is NOT a gate failure — readiness must be resolved from Engram instead of from these fields.

## Action Context Guard

The orchestrator MUST carry `actionContext` into any phase launch.

- If `mode: workspace-planning` and `allowedEditRoots` is empty, stop before editing, verifying implementation ownership, syncing specs, or archiving. Treat linked repos and folders as read-only planning context.
- If `allowedEditRoots` is present, only edit or move files within those roots.
- If a phase cannot prove a file is inside the authoritative workspace or allowed edit roots, stop and ask for clarification.

## Engine Authority by Store

- `openspec` and `both` (when `openspec/` directory exists): the native status engine resolves artifact state from disk and is authoritative. Phase executors must obey it.
- `engram`, `none`, and `both` (when `openspec/` directory does NOT exist): the native status engine cannot read Engram artifacts. It returns `nextRecommended: "resolve-via-engram"` and empty `blockedReasons`. This output is **non-authoritative**. The orchestrator must resolve readiness directly from Engram using the Engram memory tools injected by the memory provider on the change topic keys (`sdd/{change-name}/proposal`, `sdd/{change-name}/spec`, etc.) instead of relying on the engine's dependency states. The `artifactStore` field still reflects the real chosen store value (e.g. `"both"`) and must not be rewritten.

## Native Runtime Attempt Authority

The compact SDD runtime attempt authority is separate from artifact dispatch and status. It is artifact-store agnostic: the same acquire/settle discipline applies to `openspec`, `engram`, `both`, and `none` stores. Its payload MUST NOT be embedded in the SDD v1 status schema above; status reports artifact state only, never attempt tokens or attempt counters. No OpenSpec or Engram attempt ledger may be created or mirrored by Pi.

Before every runtime-bearing `sdd-apply`, `sdd-verify`, or remediation launch, the orchestrator MUST acquire a bounded attempt from the provider compact CLI; after the external run completes it MUST settle. The acquire and settle request IDs are distinct; an operation's own request ID is reused only for idempotent replay of that exact operation. Continuation routes only from the provider-returned `proceed|blocked|complete` — launch only on `proceed`, stop on `blocked` or `complete`. `reset` is never automatic and requires an explicit maintainer scope decision.

For the exact compact acquire/settle shapes and the full field semantics, see the `Native Runtime Attempt Authority` section of the lazy-loaded `SDD Orchestrator Workflow` contract. Do not look up `assets/...` paths at runtime; those are package source paths before installation.

## Status Output

Every command or agent that acts on a change MUST show or consume status before doing phase work:

- active change selection and how it was resolved;
- artifact statuses and paths/topics used as context;
- task progress and unchecked task list when tasks exist;
- next recommended action;
- any `actionContext` or edit-root warnings.
